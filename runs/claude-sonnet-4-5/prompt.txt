You are an expert competitive programmer. 
You will be provided with a problem statement, first analyze the problem, then provide your solution in Python. 
Consider edge cases, time complexity, and space complexity. 
Make sure your solution handles all constraints mentioned in the problem. 
Your final solution should be a complete, compilable Python program in a python codeblock.

**Weighted Sliding Display**

You are given $n$ artifacts. Artifact $i$ has an aura value $a_i$. You are also given weights $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$ (weights may be negative).

First, build a deterministic lineup:

- Create pairs $(a_i, i)$ for $i=1..n$.
- Sort these pairs by increasing $a_i$, and if $a_i$ are equal, by increasing $i$.
- Let the sorted aura values be $v_0, v_1, \dots, v_{n-1}$ in this order.

Now you will produce an array $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ by taking elements from $v$ using the following rule:

- Choose any starting index $s$ ($0 \le s \le n-1$) and set $p_1 = v_s$.
- Mark position $s$ as taken. The taken positions always form an interval $[L, R]$ (initially $L=R=s$).
- For each step $k=2..n$, you must take exactly one element adjacent to the current taken interval:
  - if $L>0$, you may take $v_{L-1}$ (then set $L := L-1$),
  - if $R<n-1$, you may take $v_{R+1}$ (then set $R := R+1$).

For each prefix $p_1..p_i$, define:
- $\min_i = \min(p_1, p_2, \dots, p_i)$
- $\max_i = \max(p_1, p_2, \dots, p_i)$

The weighted score of the process is:
$$
\text{Score}(p) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \cdot (\max_i - \min_i).
$$

For each test case, find the maximum possible score over all valid ways to construct $p$.

**Input Format:-**

The first line contains an integer $t$ — the number of test cases.

For each test case:
- The first line contains an integer $n$.
- The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$.
- The third line contains $n$ integers $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$.

**Output Format:-**

For each test case, output one integer — the maximum achievable score.

**Constraints:-**

- $1 \le t \le 20$
- $1 \le n \le 2000$
- $\sum n \le 2000$ over all test cases
- $1 \le a_i \le 10^9$
- $-10^6 \le w_i \le 10^6$
- The answer fits in signed 64-bit integer.
